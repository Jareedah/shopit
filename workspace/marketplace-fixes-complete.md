# Marketplace Functionality Fixes - Complete Report

## 🎯 **Issues Addressed This Session**

### ✅ **ISSUE 1: Listing Ownership Buttons (FIXED)**
**Problem**: Users saw "Contact Seller" and "Purchase Item" for their own listings
**Impact**: Confusing UX - users can't contact themselves or buy their own items
**Solution**: Implemented ownership detection with conditional button display

#### **Fix Details:**
- Added `setupActionButtons(listing)` function to `listings/view.html`
- Compares `currentUser.id` with `listing.sellerId` to determine ownership
- **For Owners**: Shows "✏️ Edit Listing", "📊 Manage Bids", "📈 View Analytics"
- **For Buyers**: Shows "💬 Contact Seller", "🛒 Purchase Item", "❤️ Add to Favorites"
- Added appropriate click handlers with proper navigation and feedback

#### **Result**: ✅ Users now see contextually appropriate actions for listings

### ✅ **ISSUE 2: Location-Based Filtering (FIXED)**
**Problem**: Distance filtering in marketplace not working
**Root Cause**: Main `listings.json` file was empty (data was in `sample-listings.json`)
**Solution**: Populated main listings file with sample data and enhanced location handling

#### **Fix Details:**
- Copied sample listings to main `listings.json` file
- Enhanced search interface with user location display
- Added location update functionality in search filters
- Created comprehensive location debugging tools
- Enhanced SearchEngine with `updateUserLocation()` and `getUserLocation()` methods

#### **Result**: ✅ Distance filtering now works with sample data

### ✅ **ISSUE 3: Map Integration (ENHANCED)**
**Problem**: Map not working properly, needs optimization
**Solution**: Enhanced map initialization, user location handling, and marker display

#### **Fix Details:**
- Enhanced SearchEngine map initialization with better error handling
- Added map reinitialization when user location changes
- Improved marker management and user location display
- Created comprehensive map debugging tools (`debug-search.html`)
