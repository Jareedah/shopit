# üîç FORENSIC INVESTIGATION: Main Branch Trading Process

## üö® **CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES DISCOVERED**

### **Issue 1: Dual Order Storage Systems (BROKEN DATA FLOW)**
- **Problem**: Default iPhone order uses different flow than new orders
- **Root Cause**: Two separate order storage mechanisms
- **Impact**: Orders appear in different places, inconsistent escrow flow

### **Issue 2: Stock Updates Not Global (ISOLATED PER USER)**
- **Problem**: Stock depletion only visible to individual users, not global
- **Root Cause**: Using localStorage instead of shared data files
- **Impact**: Multiple users can purchase same items, overselling occurs

### **Issue 3: Seller Sales Visibility Gap (NO SALES TRACKING)**
- **Problem**: Sellers have no way to see sales activities or purchases
- **Root Cause**: Missing seller sales dashboard and notification system
- **Impact**: Sellers blind to their business performance

### **Issue 4: Inconsistent Escrow Integration**
- **Problem**: Sample orders follow escrow flow, new orders don't
- **Root Cause**: Different order creation paths with different integrations
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience and payment security
