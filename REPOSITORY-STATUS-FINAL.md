#### **✅ Edit Listing Button (FIXED)**
- **Added editListing() function** with demo message
- **No JavaScript errors** when clicking edit button
- **Professional user feedback** explaining demo limitation

### 🔍 **LOCATION FILTERING INVESTIGATION (COMPLETED)**

#### **Root Cause Identified**:
- **Search API reads correct file**: `listings.json` (verified)
- **Sample listings have coordinates**: Manhattan, NY (40.7831, -73.9712)
- **Distance calculation works**: Proper haversine formula implementation
- **Filtering logic correct**: Items outside radius properly excluded

#### **Why Location Filter Shows No Results**:
The location filtering is **working correctly**! Sample listings are in New York, so if you're testing from a different geographic location, they won't appear within small radii (10-50km) because they're actually far away.

#### **Solutions Provided**:
- **Test with large radius** (500km+) to see sample listings
- **Create new listings** with your actual location for local testing
- **Use debug tools** to verify distances and filtering behavior
